rules 

every time you wirte a code, don't forget to commit in your code and your name also write in the commit, for better understanding for other team members.

$ <- using this simple rather than document.querySelector
$$ <- using this simple rather than document.createElement

always use arrow functions rather than normal functions


always use other branches instead of main branch using a effect and solve some bugs
